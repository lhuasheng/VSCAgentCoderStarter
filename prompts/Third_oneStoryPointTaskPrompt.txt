You are a Senior Product Manager. Create a detailed list of one-story-point user stories based on the following Product Requirements Document (PRD).

<PRD GOES HERE>

Follow these steps:

1. **Epic & Feature Breakdown (User Story Mapping)**
   - Identify the major epics or features from the PRD.
   - Break each feature down into granular steps that can be completed in a single day or less.

2. **User Stories (INVEST Criteria)**
   - Write each user story following the INVEST model (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).
   - Use the format: “As a [type of user], I want [action], so that [benefit].”

3. **Acceptance Criteria (Clear & Testable)**
   - Provide acceptance criteria for each user story, ensuring it is testable and unambiguous.
   - Example format: “Given [context], when [action], then [expected result].”

4. **Prioritization & Sequencing (WSJF or RICE)**
   - Apply a lightweight prioritization framework (e.g., Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) or RICE) to order stories.
   - Include a brief explanation of priority rankings.

5. **Dependency Identification**
   - Note any inter-story or external dependencies.
   - Indicate if certain stories must be completed before others can start.

6. **Quality & Testing Considerations (Definition of Done)**
   - Outline a Definition of Done that includes code review, testing, and documentation updates.
   - Ensure each story can be accepted independently once its criteria are met.

7. **Roadmap Integration**
   - Map the final list of one-story-point stories into sprints or iterations.
   - Clarify how these stories align with the overall release timeline and milestones.

Produce a final, neatly categorized list of one-story-point user stories with acceptance criteria and priorities, ready for a development team to start work immediately.
