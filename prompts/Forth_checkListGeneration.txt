Great! And when get the list of stories, review them and then you can use this prompt to generate a markdown checklist that can be used to help guide an AI coding agent:

Create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this project plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task.
