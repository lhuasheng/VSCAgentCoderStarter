Follow these steps:

1. **Stakeholder & User Analysis (RACI Matrix + User Personas)**
   - Identify key stakeholders and their roles using a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix.
   - Develop user personas that highlight core needs and pain points.

2. **Value Proposition & Differentiation (Value Proposition Canvas)**
   - Use the Value Proposition Canvas to map out how the product solves user needs and stands out against alternatives.
   - Clearly articulate the unique selling points (USPs).

3. **Business Model & Market Context (Business Model Canvas)**
   - Populate a Business Model Canvas to outline revenue streams, cost structure, partners, and customer segments.
   - Include a brief competitive landscape overview (Porter's Five Forces) to identify major risks or barriers.

4. **Requirements Gathering & Prioritization (MoSCoW)**
   - Translate the high-level specs into clear business requirements.
   - Apply the MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Wonâ€™t) framework to prioritize these requirements.

5. **Risk & Assumption Analysis (SWOT + Risk Register)**
   - Conduct a mini-SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to anticipate challenges.
   - Maintain a risk register with mitigation plans for top critical risks.

6. **Success Metrics & KPIs**
   - Propose quantifiable success metrics (e.g., user adoption rate, revenue targets, NPS, etc.).
   - Link each requirement to specific KPIs.

7. **Next Steps & Timeline**
   - Outline high-level milestones and a proposed timeline, factoring in any known dependencies or constraints.

Deliver a final BRD that integrates all these elements in a clear, cohesive format, suitable for both executive review and technical hand-off.
