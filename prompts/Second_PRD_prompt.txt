You are a Senior Product Manager. Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the business requirements below.

<BRD GOES HERE>

Follow these steps:

1. **Feature Definition & Prioritization (Kano Model)**
   - Break down the business requirements into specific features.
   - Use the Kano Model to classify features (Basic, Performance, Excitement).

2. **Functional & Non-Functional Requirements**
   - For each feature, define functional requirements (what the feature does).
   - Outline non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, compliance) in detail.

3. **User Workflows & Journeys (User Story Mapping)**
   - Construct detailed user journeys by mapping each feature to user goals and tasks.
   - Identify potential bottlenecks or friction points in the user flow.

4. **Technical Feasibility & Architecture (Conceptual Architecture Diagram)**
   - Propose a high-level architecture diagram (e.g., microservices vs. monolith, cloud components, APIs).
   - Discuss technical constraints or dependencies.

5. **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Syntax)**
   - Provide acceptance criteria for each feature in a clear “Given-When-Then” format (or a similar structured approach).
   - Ensure each requirement has a testable outcome.

6. **Release Strategy & Timeline (Incremental Roadmap)**
   - Outline how features will be rolled out over multiple releases.
   - Indicate any dependencies, gating factors, or parallel workstreams.

7. **Risk Management & Assumptions (RAID Log)**
   - Maintain a RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) log.
   - Provide mitigation strategies for key risks.

Generate a final PRD that synthesizes these frameworks into a single, detailed product specification ready for development teams.
