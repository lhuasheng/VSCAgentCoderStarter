- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Add comments for complex logic and public APIs.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write modular, reusable code.
- Always handle errors and edge cases.
- Use a checklist of tasks (e.g., .cursor-tasks.md) to track progress and break down features.
- Use templates (e.g., .cursor-template.xml) for generating task lists and stories.
- Leverage AI coding tools for rapid prototyping and refactoring, but always review and test generated code.
- Follow the best practices and structure from the Next AI Starter template for integrating AI, background jobs, and infrastructure services.
- Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository.
- Validate and sanitize all user input.
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Keep dependencies up to date and review for vulnerabilities.
- Write tests for critical paths and edge cases.
- Document all setup, build, and deployment steps in README.md.
- Provide onboarding documentation and checklists for new team members (e.g., setup steps, key contacts, project overview).
- Encourage mentorship and knowledge sharing within the team.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for key decisions, architecture, and processes to support knowledge transfer.
- Ensure departing team members document critical knowledge and hand off responsibilities effectively.
